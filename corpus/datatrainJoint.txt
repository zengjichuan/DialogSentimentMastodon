3 -_I that's why I felt confusion when I compare the manga to the Anime . I really wonder Why it was desperately forced to end that badly . üò≠ üò≠ üò≠ 9129178
4 -_I I was to disappointed by watching the end , then someone said me anime didn't follow the manga so there's no chance of 2nd season . Damn I wonder why such things happen with amazing animes .. 9130246
5 -_I when I read it in the net , most if there comments said that because the anime is more on violence that's why theres no chance of having a second season . I wonder why it only happens to beelzebub üò≠ üò≠ 9500341
6 -_D nah that's not the reason , just think that anime doesn't follow the manga and adds it's own story and fillers , makes no sense , 9503664
7 -_O so what do you think they'll show in 2nd season ? 9503664
8 +_I and sadly I love this anime as it's the best delinquent based anime xD . 9503664
